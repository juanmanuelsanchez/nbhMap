I'm retrieving data from Foursquare API . &#xD;-Add data to Model.&#xD;-Initialize View returning data from the model to build a &quot;listview&quot; and a &quot;mapview&quot;.&#xD;-When working on the &quot;listview&quot;, add a similar stucture as 10Cat Clicker MVC Premium Pro's **listView** code: create all the variables including the ones for the map outside the for loop. Add a for loop and, inside of it, goes an addEventListener function with a closure. In that closure, as a minimun, add a call for pinPoster(location). This is going to initialize the &quot;mapview&quot;. The code for the map goes outside the for loop.&#xD;-Add the filter functionality with search bar as a form input.
