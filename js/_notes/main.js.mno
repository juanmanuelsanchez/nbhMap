<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><info>	<infoitem key="notes" value="9/4/15: The &quot;listview&quot; and the &quot;mapview&quot; are rendered. I suggest these following steps:&#xD;-Create the same &quot;render&quot; function for the list items and for the map. Initialize the map outside the for loop. &#xD;-Inside the for loop call pinPoster(locations).&#xD;-It's key the placeData object to create the markers inside the loop.&#xD;-Call setAnimation inside the listener?&#xD;7/4/15: Continue working in MVC version of nbhMap in vanilla JS. The HTML file is implemented at it's basis. Responsive design is made with Boilerplate. I'm retrieving data from Foursquare API . &#xD;-Add data to Model.&#xD;-Initialize View returning data from the model to build a &quot;listview&quot; and a &quot;mapview&quot;.&#xD;-When working on the &quot;listview&quot;, add a similar stucture as 10Cat Clicker MVC Premium Pro's **listView** code: create all the variables including the ones for the map outside the for loop. Add a for loop and, inside of it, goes an addEventListener function with a closure. In that closure, as a minimun, add a call for pinPoster(location). This is going to initialize the &quot;mapview&quot;. The code for the map goes outside the for loop.&#xD;-Add the filter functionality with search bar as a form input.
